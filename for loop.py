# '''Basic for loop'''
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print("I love", fruit)

# for num in range(1,6):
#     print(num)

'''For loop with range'''
# Initialize a variable to store the sum
# total_sum = 0

# Loop from 1 to 5 (inclusive)
# for num in range(3, 200):
#     total_sum += num  # Add the current number to the total_sum
#
# # Print the result
# print("The sum of numbers from 3 to 200 is:", total_sum)

'''For loop with range and optional step value'''
for i in range(1,21,2): # From 1-20 skipping every other number
    print(i)
